# What I did wrong today
Today's screwups are so bad it warrants this... thing.

Today's challange nr 2 was as my english teacher wouyld put it "a pain in the ole' familiar spot". I got challange 1 correct on pure luck.
So what I did wrong was floats and trying to correct them and shid, all I actually needed to do was put a round() on
```cpp
int Î”Range = round((float)(range.second - range.first) / 2);
```
